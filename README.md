This is a game similar to beat mania or dance dance revolution or guitar hero. The four keys are Q, W, O, and P and you score by pressing the correct key when it has reached the green zone at the top. I used event handlers to handle the key up event of the letters and determine their coordinates in the window compared to the green zone coordinates.
